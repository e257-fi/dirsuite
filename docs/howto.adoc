different aspects of DirSuite. These are runnable projects,

 * link:../examples/tests/[test cases] Test cases which are used by examples. 

 * link:../examples/src/test/scala/DirSuiteDemo.scala[DirSuiteDemo]
   Example of typical usage of DirSuite

 * link:../examples/src/test/scala/MapArgsDemo.scala[MapArgsDemo]
   Example of how to map and change test's arguments by DirSuite test
   (e.g. to provide extra arguments for conf file in actual test code). 

 * link:../examples/src/test/scala/FailureDemo.scala[FailureDemo]

   These ignored tests will all fail,  if you enable them by changing
